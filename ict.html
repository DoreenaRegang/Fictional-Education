        <h3>What is ICT?</h3>
        <p><em>ICT is formed of several different components, including:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hardware – computers, printers and other physical technology devices</li>
            <li>Software – operating systems and programs installed on ICT hardware devices. These are used to create files such as spreadsheets, databases, presentations and text-based documents</li>
            <li>Communication systems – telephone lines and wireless signals, which enable connections with other ICT users and the internet</li>
            <li>Online data sharing platforms – for example, using a video-calling application such as Skype or sharing files on a cloud-based system</li>
        </ul>
